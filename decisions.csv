1. Extract the relevant information from the loan application and customer info API results using the `json` library.

2. Check if the loan application has been approved or rejected by comparing the `decision` field in the JSON response to ""Apprové"" or ""Rejeté"". If it's not in this list, we can assume that the loan application was rejected.

3. Check if the customer info API returned a 404 error code, which indicates that the customer information could not be found. In this case, we can assume that the customer has no credit history or is not eligible for the loan.

4. If the loan application was approved, we can check if the `reason` field in the JSON response matches the ""High income"" reason provided in the context. If it does, we can assume that the loan amount is affordable and the customer is eligible for a low-interest rate.

5. If the loan application was rejected or there's no `decision` field in the JSON response, we can check if there are any red flags in the customer info API result. For example, if there's a ""red flag"" indicating that the customer has a poor credit history or is not eligible for the loan, we can assume that the loan application was rejected due to this reason.

6. If all of these checks pass, we can proceed with the decision and response JSON as per the context provided."
