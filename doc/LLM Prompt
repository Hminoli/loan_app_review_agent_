LLM Prompt Design

1. Component Overview
The LLM component provides AI-driven reasoning for loan approval or rejection using Mistral LLM via Ollama integrated with LangGraph.

2. Responsibilities

Designed prompts to pass loan application details to the LLM.
Ensured the LLM explains decisions in natural language.
Integrated LLM output into the decision pipeline.

3. Technical Details

LLM Used: Mistral 7B via Ollama (local inference).
Framework: LangGraph for step-by-step orchestration.

Core Features:

Prompt creation with applicant details.
Generate decision explanations.
Offline fallback (if LLM unavailable, pipeline still works).

4. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: LLM outputs were sometimes unstructured.
Solution: Added JSON cleaning + fallback logic.
Challenge: Model pulling issues (internet/firewall).
Solution: Provided fallback to rule-based decisioning.

5. Testing & Validation

Tested prompts with multiple applicants (approve/reject/manual).
Verified explanations matched loan decisions.

6. Future Improvements

Fine-tune prompts for domain-specific loan policies.
