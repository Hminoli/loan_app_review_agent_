1. Component Overview


The UI component provides an interface for users to submit loan applications and view the review decision from the backend/LLM.

2. Responsibilities

Designed and implemented a simple, user-friendly frontend.
Integrated UI with API endpoints.
Displayed loan review decisions clearly.

3. Technical Details

Framework Options:
Streamlit for Python-based UI.
React.js as an alternative for production ready web frontend.

Core Features:

Form to enter loan details.
Submit button to call API.
Display of results (Approved/Rejected/Flag + Explanation).
KPI metrics and decision history with CSV download.

4. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: API integration errors
The UI needed to send data to the backend (/agent_review) and get responses.
Sometimes APIs failed (wrong URL, backend down, validation errors).
Why it’s valid: You had to handle failed requests gracefully so the app doesn’t crash.

Solution: Used Python requests library for stable POST/GET calls.
Added error handling → UI shows a clear error message if backend fails.

5. Testing & Validation

Tested UI inputs with dummy loan applications.
Ensured correct request/response flow with API.
Validated KPI metrics update correctly after each submission.

6. Future Improvements

Add login system for users.
Make UI mobile-friendly.
Enhance styling with charts and themes.
