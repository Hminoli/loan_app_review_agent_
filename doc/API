API Simulation

1. Component Overview
The API provides backend services for validating inputs, running decision pipelines, and returning structured loan decisions.

2. Responsibilities

Developed FastAPI endpoints for loan reviews, KPIs, and history.
Handled validation using Pydantic schemas.
Integrated API with database and pipeline.

3. Technical Details

Framework: FastAPI.
Endpoints:

/agent_review → runs pipeline, returns decision.
/kpis → fetches approval/rejection stats.
/decisions → shows history.
/mock/kyc + /mock/credit → simulates external checks.
Server: Uvicorn for running API.

4. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Input validation errors.
Solution: Used Pydantic validators for ranges (e.g., age 18–100).
Challenge: CORS issues with frontend.
Solution: Added CORS middleware.

5. Testing & Validation

Tested with Postman and curl requests.
Verified error handling for invalid inputs.

6. Future Improvements

Add authentication (JWT).

Replace mock APIs with real KYC/credit APIs.
