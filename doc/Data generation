Data Generation

1. Component Overview
The data generation component creates synthetic loan applications for testing the system.

2. Responsibilities

Designed scripts to generate sample loan applicant data.
Provided CSV files for quick testing.
Enabled database seeding with synthetic records.

3. Technical Details

Formats Used: CSV for import/export, SQLite for structured storage.
Libraries: Python (random, pandas).

Core Features:

Random applicant details (age, income, credit score, purpose).
Export to data/applicants.csv.
Load into SQLite for persistence.

4. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Ensuring realistic values (e.g., credit score 300â€“900).
Solution: Applied domain-specific ranges and constraints.
Challenge: Duplicate/random noise in data.
Solution: Used seeded random generation.

5. Testing & Validation

Verified CSV imports match database schema.
Ran pipeline with generated applicants to test performance.

6. Future Improvements

Add more attributes (location, occupation).
Simulate fraud cases for AML testing.
